🎯 Deepfake Detection Model
🛠 How the Model Works
Our deepfake detection system leverages AI-powered machine learning to identify synthetic or manipulated media content such as videos, images, and audio. Here’s a breakdown of the workflow:

1️⃣ Data Input & Preprocessing
Video/Audio Input: The model accepts media files for analysis.
Frame Extraction: For videos, frames are extracted using OpenCV for image-based analysis.
Feature Analysis: The media content is preprocessed to highlight patterns indicative of deepfake manipulations:
Blink Detection: Eye movement irregularities (frequency and consistency).
Face Artifacts: Pixel anomalies and boundary mismatches.
Voice Analysis: Frequency distortions and unnatural pitch for deepfake audio.
2️⃣ Model Architecture
The deepfake detection system is powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image and frame analysis.
For videos, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks detect temporal inconsistencies between frames.
The model processes:
Pixel-Level Data: Detects blending artifacts.
Facial Movement: Identifies inconsistencies in lip sync, blinking, and expressions.
3️⃣ Model Training
Dataset: The model is trained on well-known deepfake datasets such as:
FaceForensics++
Celeb-DF
DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge).
Training Framework: Leveraging TensorFlow and PyTorch for training.
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy loss is used for classification (Real vs Fake).
4️⃣ Inference & Output
Once the model analyzes the media file, it outputs:
Detection Confidence: A percentage score indicating the likelihood of the content being fake.
Visual Indicators: Highlighting specific regions with artifacts (e.g., face boundaries).
Prediction:
Real or Deepfake.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
